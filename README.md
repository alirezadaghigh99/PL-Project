# CE40364 Project
An interpreter written in Racket for a given programming language. This code is developed for [CE40364 (Design of Programming Languages) Course Project.](http://ce.sharif.edu/courses/99-00/1/ce364-1/index.php)

## Getting Started
- Download and install DrRacket based on your platform.([here](https://download.racket-lang.org/))
- [Clone](https://github.com/alirezadaghigh99/PL-Project) project
- Run [interpreter.rkt](https://github.com/alirezadaghigh99/PL-Project/blob/master/interpreter.rkt)

## Source Code
Source code is consisted of four parts. Functionality of each part will be explained in this part.

### parser-lexer.rkt
As its name shows, this module does lexical analysis process and then creates parser according to given grammar.

### environment.rkt
This module defines environment functions to store variables and their values.

### operations.rkt
This module is used for handling defined operations, such as addition, multiplication, comparison, list operations, etc. Error handling is done in this module too.

### interpreter.rkt
This module is main module and combines all other parts to compute value of given program by interpreting input language to Racket.
